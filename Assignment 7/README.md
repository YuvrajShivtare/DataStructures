# Create a matrix class.

Read in a file mat.dat

Line 1 of the file will have an integer, n.  This line is the size of the square matrix to follow.
Line 2 will be empty. 
Line 3 to n + 2 of the file will have the elements of an n ùóë n matrix, M, columns separated by spaces. Each row of M on a different line.
Line n+ 3 will be empty.
Line n + 4 to 2n + 4 will have the elements of a bRn vector with each element on a different line.

Use your matrix class to solve the system Mx=b.  Print x to the screen.
