Part I

Write a trie as seen following the links below.

Part II:

For this part you will have to read in a number of files. Each file will contain a number of words separated by spaces.  If any of the files are not found, print a file not found message to the screen, and skip to part III.

Write code to read a file, testAdd.txt.  Create an instance of Trie, and add the words in testTrieAdd.txt to the trie.

Read in a second file, testContains.txt.  Print to the screen all of the words in testContains.txt that your trie contains.

Read in testTriePrefix.txt. Print to the screen all the words in your trie that begin with the words or prefixes in testTriePrefix.

Read in  testRemove.txt.  Remove from your trie all the words in testRemove.txt.

Print your trie.

 

Part III:

Create a new trie.  Add all the words in this dictionary to your trie.

https://github.com/StevensDeptECE/CPE593/blob/master/dict.txt (Links to an external site.)

Use the trie you just created to find the number of times non-words appear in the file prideandprejudice.txt (Links to an external site.). 

https://github.com/StevensDeptECE/CPE593/blob/master/prideandprejudice.txt (Links to an external site.)

By non-words, I mean any word that does not appear in the dictionary, exactly as it appears in the dictionary.  For example, the word 'hippopotamus' may appear in the dictionary while the word 'Hippopotamus' does not, so every appearance of 'Hippopotamus' would count toward your non-words.

Your trie may assume that any string with a non-letter is not a word.  For these purposes, a non-letter is any character that is not a lower case letter 'a' - 'z'.

 

Part IV

Write a linear chaining hashmap as seen below.  The hashmap should have 500,000 cells.

Part V

For this part you will have to read in a number of files. Each file will contain a number of words separated by spaces. 
If any of the files are not found, print a file not found message to the screen, and skip to part VI.

Write code to read a file, testAdd.txt.  Create an instance of hashmap, and add the words in testAdd.txt to the hashmap.

Output the hashmap's histogram to the screen.

Read in a second file, testContains.txt.  Print to the screen all of the words in testContains.txt that your hashmap contains.

Read in  testRemove.txt.  Remove from your hashmap all the words in testRemove.txt.

Print your hashmap.

 

Part VI

Create a new instance of hashmap.  Add all the words in this dictionary to your hashmap.

https://github.com/StevensDeptECE/CPE593/blob/master/dict.txt (Links to an external site.)

Use the hashmap you just created to find the number of times non-words appear in the file prideandprejudice.txt (Links to an external site.). 

https://github.com/StevensDeptECE/CPE593/blob/master/prideandprejudice.txt (Links to an external site.)

By non-words, I mean any word that does not appear in the dictionary, exactly as it appears in the dictionary. 
For example, the word 'hippopotamus' may appear in the dictionary while the word 'Hippopotamus' does not, so every appearance of 'Hippopotamus' would count toward your non-words.
